# FitzHugh-Nagumo
Stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo single neuron model.

The purpose of this analysis was to study the distributions of the neuronâ€™s spikes generation
and the interspikes interval times (ISI) statistic affected by two type of stochastic noises: Wiener and OrnsteinUhlenbeck noises.
The expected distribution of the number of spikes in a fixed time interval is Poissonian distribution in the regime of ISI's exponential distribution for the ISI.
The analysis includes observations on how the temperature influences the amplitude of the noise. The results shows how the two stochastic noises affects differently the FHN system.

On one branch you'll find the paper of the project, the .py branch contains the python codes used to perform the analysis of the trajectory, isitimes and spikes generation.
