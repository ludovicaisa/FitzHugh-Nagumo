# FitzHugh-Nagumo
Project done for the exam of Complex System about the neuron's model FHN (stochastic).
The purpose of this analysis was to study the distributions of the FitzHugh-Nagumo systemâ€™s spikes generation
and the interspikes interval times (ISI) statistic affected by two type of stochastic noises: Wiener and OrnsteinUhlenbeck noises. Their expected distributions are the Poisson distribution for the number of spikes generated by
the system in a fixed time interval and Exponential distribution for the ISI. The analysis includes observations
varying the temperature which defines the amplitude of the noises. The results are about as expected, which leads
to considerations about how the two stochastic noises affects differently the FHN system.

On one branch you'll find the paper of the project, the .py branch contains the python codes used to perform the analysis of the trajectory, isitimes and spikes generation.

If you want to improve something please fork it and we can talk about it!
Thank you again and solidarity among geeks ðŸ¤“
